This is a machine learning project for detecting fake news.
To run the project, follow the below steps

- install all the dependencies in the requirement.txt
- run the main.py file using the command ```python main.py``` in terminal

This will take some time depending on your machine specifications.
After some time the frontend part of the project will be served on the ```localhost:5000``` port.

You can enter any news and press submit button to check if the news is fake or not.

the project uses 4 different classification algorithm namely:

1. Logistic Regression
2.	Decision Tree
3.	Gradient Boosting
4.	Random Forest

The accuracy and precision for each model will be visible in the terminal.
